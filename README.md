# **Project Summary**
HobbySwap is a web-based trading and marketplace platform designed for collctors of all kinds - from trading cards and figurines to blind boxes and more. Collectors today face major challenges when trying to complete or manage their collections. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or conventions are currently the most common methods used for trading and selling collectibles. However, these platforms are not designed for direct item-for-item exchanges and often leave collectors exposed to scams, inflated prices, and unreliable trade partners. To close the gap between serious collectors, sellers, and causal hobbyist, we aim to establish a reliable online marketplace and community platform where collectors can trade collectibles in a fair and secure manner.
